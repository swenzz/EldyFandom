                        Radahn is a Legend Boss in Elden Ring. Starscourge Radahn is heralded as one of the mightiest living demigods, having fought Malenia the Severed to a standstill during the war of the Shattering. However, his resulting affliction with the Scarlet Rot caused him to be driven to insanity, crippling him and reducing him to a state of feral rage.

                        Hoarah Loux, Warrior is a two-phase Legend Boss in Elden Ring. Godfrey was Queen Marika's first consort, and thus the first Elden Lord of the Lands Between. Before earning this title, he was known as Hoarah Loux, the chieftain of the badlands and a bloodthirsty warrior. Godfrey took the Beast Regent Serosh upon his back after committing to his role as a Lord in order to suppress his violent urges.
